Hi ðŸ‘‹! My name is Olivier Schweitzer and I'm a full stack web engineer.
I mostly work with JavaScript and TypeScript through Node.js (Express, NestJS) for backends and Angular and React for frontends. 
I'm also interested in Docker deployment with Docker Swarm, Compose or Kubernetes. 
I also develop some Python applications or scripts from time to time.

I developed my own website with Gatsby.js, Contentful and Netlify, it's available [HERE](https://www.oschweitzer.dev/) :innocent:
